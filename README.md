# uniplace
GitHub repository that includes all the information about the uniplace prototype and its functionalities. This project is part of the learning obtained in the Software Engineering course at the Universitat Pompeu Fabra, Barcelona. Here you can find all kinds of information about the project: from basic information about how it works to images of the prototype designed by the team.

# Who we are?
The team is composed of different members: Andreu Gordillo, Alex Herrero, Arnau Ruiz, Bernat Treserres, Gen√≠s Lloses, Guillem Robledo and Marc Vallcorba. All of us are studying different types of engineering: mainly computer engineering and telecommunication network engineering, in Universitat Pompeu Fabra.

# What is uniplace?
uniplace was born out of the need for students who want to study higher education to find a degree and a center that adapts to their needs and fulfills all their expectations, allowing them to read opinions and comments from current students and graduates about the different degrees and subjects offered in each of the centers and to obtain information from them, thus creating a large network of students to exchange their points of view about higher education.

# Methods used
For the development of this project, different technologies have been used. The most commonly used are, for example, Agile, Kanban, Design Thinking and User Stories methodologies. In addition, we have used the Figma application for the development of the prototype.
